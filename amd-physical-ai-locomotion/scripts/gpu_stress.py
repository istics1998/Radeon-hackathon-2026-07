"""GPU kernel-launch stress probe — the fast, dependency-light reproducer for
the rocprofiler HSA-layer race (docs/HANDOFF.md §9.3).

Why this exists (separate from scripts/repro_hsa_segfault.py):
  * repro_hsa_segfault.py needs brax + mujoco_playground and runs a real PPO
    step — great as a final confirmation, slow to iterate.
  * This file is pure JAX. It hammers the SAME layer that crashes — the
    per-kernel-launch path that rocprofiler-sdk intercepts — using a deep
    ``lax.scan`` (nested WhileThunk, the shape rocgdb caught) PLUS a long loop
    of separate dispatches. That maximises both "single-dispatch while-body
    volume" and "number of dispatches", the two knobs §9.4 says drive the race.

It prints a single sentinel line ``STRESS_OK <token>`` iff it survives every
round. A segfault in libhsa-runtime64 kills the process before that line, so
the WRAPPER (scripts/pathA_profiler_free.sh) decides pass/fail by exit code +
sentinel, NOT by anything this script returns — a segfaulting process cannot
report its own death.

Tunables (env vars):
  STRESS_ROUNDS   how many independent dispatch rounds        (default 8)
  STRESS_SCAN     lax.scan length per round (while-body depth) (default 4096)
  STRESS_N        square matmul dimension                      (default 512)
  STRESS_TOKEN    sentinel token echoed on success             (default "ok")
